# An Evolutionary Algorithm Approach to Job Shop Scheduling Optimization
The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem in the field of operations research. It is a problem of determining an optimal sequence of jobs to be processed on each machine such that the makespan (the time it takes to complete all jobs) is minimized. The evolutionary algorithm is put into place with the help of the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library.
